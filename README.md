# Face Shape Analyzer

The Face Shape Analyzer is a Node.js application that uses the `face-api.js` library to analyze human faces. It captures a live video feed from the user's webcam, takes a photo, and measures the width, height, and shape of the face. This tool can be used for various applications, such as beauty analysis, virtual makeup, or personalized recommendations.
